            I worked as a programmer in this caveman game made with Unity in which I implemented features like the inventory system, the UI behavior, the caveman mounting dinos feature and the AI of the game.
            In this game you are a caveman surviving in the dinosaur
            era who must obtain a variety of materials through exploration, mining, and hunting.

          <h2>
          For a school project on art history I decided to make this little
          Unity game based on the 19th century French impressionist movement,
            this movement was characterized by portraying people doing
             everyday things like walking through meadows and relaxing,
              that is why all the design The game revolves around this 
              premise: the settings are some of the most famous paintings of
               the movement, the visual style was created with the same 
               technique of short brush strokes, the main character is the
                girl with an umbrella by Claude Monet (who was an exponent
                 of the movement) even music was part of the movement so I
                  decided to include a piece from that time; And the most 
                  interesting thing for me is that the mechanics revolve
                   around the premise, that is, the player is not going 
                   to do anything more than take a quiet walk among those
                    meadows.
